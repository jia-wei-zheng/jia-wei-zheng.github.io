In this paper, we analyse ADL data from ambient sensors to model behaviour markers on a daily basis. Using a number of machine learning and statistical methods we model a predicted daily routine for each marker, detect deviations based on a set of relative thresholds and calculate long-term drifts. We further analyse the causal factors of deviations by investigating relationships between different activities. We demonstrate our results using data from a sample of 11 participants from the CASAS dataset.

Currently, there are various isolated IoT applications developed by different IoT manufacturers for a single specific function. The IoT nodes are classified into different administrative domains according to their affiliation, resulting in a multi-domain IoT environment. In order to realize the true IoT vision with multi-domain data sharing, this paper introduces a multi-domain IoT data sharing architecture based on blockchain to address the current phenomenon of information isolation. A control approach including capability-based cross-domain access control and risk-based access control in a domain is proposed to ensure the security of full data sharing processes. With these properties, diverse isolated applications can constitute a whole system for secure data exchange.","tags":null,"title":"MicrothingsChain: Blockchain-based Controlled Data Sharing Platform in Multi-domain IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Tong","Xuewen Dong","Yulong Shen","Jiawei Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601584255,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601584255,"objectID":"7f0e32657db8f95628fb23a8cffc9d0c","permalink":"https://jw2heng.github.io/publication/bc-ran-cloud-radio-access-network-enabled-by-blockchain-for-5g/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T20:30:55.5Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bc-ran-cloud-radio-access-network-enabled-by-blockchain-for-5g/","section":"publication","summary":"Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) supports the explosion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and the demand for massive access in 5G networks. However, centralized access of trustless operators causes severe malicious insider threats, such as maliciously tamper and accidentally delete data. Blockchain, a traceable and non-tamper distributed ledger maintained by all nodes, has been considered as a feasible method to overcome these threats, while the size of the blockchain network is limited by practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm where the participants, the nodes who participate in consensus algorithm, bring heavy communication traffic. In this paper, we first propose a C-RAN enabled by blockchain (BC-RAN) for 5G with PeerTrust-based PBFT (Trust-PBFT) consensus algorithm to prevent the malicious insider threats and scale up the size of the blockchain network. We also propose a tri-chain structure of blockchain to divide transactions into three categories for storage to facilitate traceability. The algorithm calculates the trust value of each node, and those with high trust values will be elected to be the participants of PBFT. Simultaneously, due to the introduction of PeerTrust, another benefit is to improve the fault tolerance performance efficiently. Besides, an adjustment mechanism is designed-newly and implemented in the algorithm to impede effects produced by the malicious nodes in the blockchain network. Finally, several simulation experiments are designed to evaluate and compare the fault-tolerance performance and scalability of Trust-PBFT.\n\n","tags":null,"title":"BC-RAN: Cloud radio access network enabled by blockchain for 5G","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng","Xuewen Dong","Yulong Shen","Wei Tong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593635505,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593635505,"objectID":"06ae5f7ebd3d03d9230b9463892f0de4","permalink":"https://jw2heng.github.io/publication/jise/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T20:31:45.23Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jise/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, more and more Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging to make our daily life smarter. However, these IoT applications are developed in an isolated vertical architecture and suitable for a specific scene or environment. In other words, they do not exchange and reuse data between each other, resulting in the issue of IoT application isolations. To address this problem, we propose a cross-domain data sharing mechanism named MicrothingsChain, which allows the exchange and reuse of data among various applications in a collaborative way. This paradigm calls for novel security and access control mechanisms to enable resource-limited smart objects to verify a claimed access right without relying on central authorization systems. In this paper, we present a novel smart contract-based cross-domain authentication and access control mechanism for application-centric IoT. Specially, we propose a proof-of-edge computing node consensus protocol to avoid centralization in practice.

Services coming from providers can be classified with semantic annotations and placed in the specific ontology classes, which accelerates the understanding procedure for machines to quickly decompose coming requests and locate classes accurately for service composition.

Here we present our Partial-Equivalence logic in service composition, we propose an algorithm to detect the inner connections between ontology classes and enrich the annotation. Then we update the model of the workflow and operate a comparison on the performance of our Partial Equivalent compositon against traditional composition. Our experimental results show that the Partial-Equivalent logic not only offers more solutions to the request, but also simplifies the workflow and advance the performance of solutions.

However, these massive IoT data, stored in the form of isolated data centers, can not be shared by others who also need it. Moreover, data exchange is now needing a secure and fair mechanism to guarantee the data provider's rights and data security. Data providers also lack the motivation to share their data, as no effective mechanism exists to reward this behavior. To solve these problems, we propose a digital asset exchange mechanism based on blockchain technology, in which we record the behavior of data publishing and exchanging into the blockchain, which can ensure the reliability and transparency of data exchange without the restriction of trusted third-party payment institutions. Especially, to inspire the data providers to share their high-quality data, we design an incentive mechanism based on QoS, which gives higher rewards to those who provide high-quality data.

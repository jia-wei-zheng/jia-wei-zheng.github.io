Modern monitoring and activity recognition technologies, such as those relying on sensors, the IoT, statistics and AI, can produce a wealth of relevant event data. However, this data is typically characterised by noise and uncertainty, in contrast to the assumption of a deterministic event log required by conformance checking algorithms. In this paper, we extend alignment-based conformance checking to function under a probabilistic event log. We introduce a weighted trace model and weighted alignment cost function, and a custom threshold parameter that controls the level of confidence on the event data vs. the process model. The resulting algorithm considers activities of lower but sufficiently high probability that better align with the process model. We explain the algorithm and its motivation both from formal and intuitive perspectives, and demonstrate its functionality in comparison with deterministic alignment using real-life datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Alignment-based conformance checking over probabilistic events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"I gave a talk on \u0026lsquo;Digital Twin for Assisted Living\u0026rsquo; at Xidian University.\n","date":1684596114,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1684596114,"objectID":"59d98f4a54f9e082b005a4ee185483a3","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/post/xidiantalk/index/","publishdate":"2023-05-20T15:21:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/xidiantalk/index/","section":"post","summary":"Give a talk on Digital Twin for Assisted Living at Xidian University.","tags":["ADLs"],"title":"Give a talk on ''Digital Twin for Assisted Living'' at Xidian University.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"I gave a talk on \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Activities of Daily Living of Older Adults\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; at Advanced Care Research Centre, Usher Institute.\n","date":1647789714,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647789714,"objectID":"b9efea3776a5cc0fff7701ad9302ea17","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/post/usher-talk/index/","publishdate":"2022-03-20T15:21:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/usher-talk/index/","section":"post","summary":"Give a talk on ''Activities of Daily Living of Older Adults'' at Advanced Care Research Centre.","tags":["ADLs"],"title":"Give a talk on ''Activities of Daily Living of Older Adults'' at Advanced Care Research Centre.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"I presented the paper titled \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;Predictive Behavioural Monitoring and Deviation Detection in Activities of Daily Livings of Older Adults\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; at the International Conference on Health Informatics (HealthINF).\n","date":1645370514,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645370514,"objectID":"412952ff8b13632f8c904375cc607cd5","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/post/healthinf/index/","publishdate":"2022-02-20T15:21:54Z","relpermalink":"/post/healthinf/index/","section":"post","summary":"Present the work of ''Predictive Behavioural Monitoring in Activities of Daily Livings of Older Adults'' at the International Conference on Health Informatics (HealthINF).","tags":["ADLs"],"title":"Present the work of ''Predictive Behavioural Monitoring in Activities of Daily Livings of Older Adults'' at the International Conference on Health Informatics (HealthINF).","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng","Petros Papapanagiotou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642715114,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642715114,"objectID":"f4938958f2cd58f216c734e632d713d0","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/healthinf/","publishdate":"2022-01-20T21:45:14.303Z","relpermalink":"/publication/healthinf/","section":"publication","summary":"Predictive behaviour monitoring of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) can provide unique, personalised insights about an older person’s physical and cognitive health and lead to unique opportunities to support self-management, proactive intervention and promote independent living.

However, centralized access of trustless operators causes severe malicious insider threats, such as maliciously tamper and accidentally delete data. Blockchain, a traceable and non-tamper distributed ledger maintained by all nodes, has been considered as a feasible method to overcome these threats, while the size of the blockchain network is limited by practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm where the participants, the nodes who participate in consensus algorithm, bring heavy communication traffic. In this paper, we first propose a C-RAN enabled by blockchain (BC-RAN) for 5G with PeerTrust-based PBFT (Trust-PBFT) consensus algorithm to prevent the malicious insider threats and scale up the size of the blockchain network. We also propose a tri-chain structure of blockchain to divide transactions into three categories for storage to facilitate traceability. The algorithm calculates the trust value of each node, and those with high trust values will be elected to be the participants of PBFT. Simultaneously, due to the introduction of PeerTrust, another benefit is to improve the fault tolerance performance efficiently. Besides, an adjustment mechanism is designed-newly and implemented in the algorithm to impede effects produced by the malicious nodes in the blockchain network. Finally, several simulation experiments are designed to evaluate and compare the fault-tolerance performance and scalability of Trust-PBFT.\n\n","tags":null,"title":"BC-RAN: Cloud radio access network enabled by blockchain for 5G","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng","Xuewen Dong","Yulong Shen","Wei Tong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593635505,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593635505,"objectID":"06ae5f7ebd3d03d9230b9463892f0de4","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/jise/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T20:31:45.23Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jise/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, more and more Internet of Things (IoT) applications are emerging to make our daily life smarter. However, these IoT applications are developed in an isolated vertical architecture and suitable for a specific scene or environment. In other words, they do not exchange and reuse data between each other, resulting in the issue of IoT application isolations. To address this problem, we propose a cross-domain data sharing mechanism named MicrothingsChain, which allows the exchange and reuse of data among various applications in a collaborative way. This paradigm calls for novel security and access control mechanisms to enable resource-limited smart objects to verify a claimed access right without relying on central authorization systems. In this paper, we present a novel smart contract-based cross-domain authentication and access control mechanism for application-centric IoT. Specially, we propose a proof-of-edge computing node consensus protocol to avoid centralization in practice.

Finally, according to the user's requests and the QoS constraints, multipaths of service composition are generated, which satisfy the goal of load balancing. Simulation results show that our proposed methods not only can satisfy the user's requests, but also find more choices for the execution of service composition.\n","tags":null,"title":"QoS-Aware Path Finding and Load Balancing in Service-Composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lingxiao Yang","Xuewen Dong","Siyu Xing","Jiawei Zheng","Xinyu Gu","Xiongfei Song"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570739326,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570739326,"objectID":"7769529dfd5d5f4d0096f726c4cc2cf2","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/an-abnormal-transaction-detection-mechanim-on-bitcoin/","publishdate":"2019-10-10T20:28:46.138Z","relpermalink":"/publication/an-abnormal-transaction-detection-mechanim-on-bitcoin/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, illegal activities such as money laundering using cryptocurrency represented by bitcoin have been emerging. The anonymity, two-way convertibility and transnational of bitcoin are used to \"launder\" illegal income. Some bitcoin theft incidents are also associated with money laundering. Hackers \"launder\" the stolen bitcoins and eventually convert them into legal property. In this paper, we explore whether these illegal activities can be detected. First, we mine the user characteristics from the original transaction data of bitcoin. Second, the user characteristics are classified to distinguish normal users from abnormal users. Third, Gaussian Mixture Model is used to cluster users to find suspicious users. Finally, we detect the abnormal transactions among the suspicious users.\n","tags":null,"title":"An Abnormal Transaction Detection Mechanim on Bitcoin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Tong","Xuewen Dong","Jiawei Zheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570739185,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570739185,"objectID":"27564f99be31fb5a61a811e83840e0e4","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/trust-pbft-a-peertrust-based-practical-byzantine-consensus-algorithm/","publishdate":"2019-10-10T20:26:25.398Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trust-pbft-a-peertrust-based-practical-byzantine-consensus-algorithm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Trust-PBFT: a PeerTrust-based Practical Byzantine Consensus Algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng","Xuewen Dong","Qihang Liu","Xinghui Zhu","Wei Tong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558902611,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558902611,"objectID":"2a9faffbe223a3304f7abdc4316d44a6","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/blockchain-based-secure-digital-asset-exchange-scheme-with-qos-aware-incentive-mechanism/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T20:30:11.903Z","relpermalink":"/publication/blockchain-based-secure-digital-asset-exchange-scheme-with-qos-aware-incentive-mechanism/","section":"publication","summary":"As the Internet of things (IoT) is increasingly popular, the number of IoT devices such as sensors and smart equipments are growing at an astonishing rate and data generated by these devices is exploding. However, these massive IoT data, stored in the form of isolated data centers, can not be shared by others who also need it. Moreover, data exchange is now needing a secure and fair mechanism to guarantee the data provider's rights and data security. Data providers also lack the motivation to share their data, as no effective mechanism exists to reward this behavior. To solve these problems, we propose a digital asset exchange mechanism based on blockchain technology, in which we record the behavior of data publishing and exchanging into the blockchain, which can ensure the reliability and transparency of data exchange without the restriction of trusted third-party payment institutions. Especially, to inspire the data providers to share their high-quality data, we design an incentive mechanism based on QoS, which gives higher rewards to those who provide high-quality data. Experimental results of this prototype demonstrate that this mechanism is appropriate to be applied in practice.\n","tags":null,"title":"Blockchain-based secure digital asset exchange scheme with QoS-aware incentive mechanism","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The aim of this research programme is below:\n  Solving information isolation resulting from vertical IoT applications.\n  Establishing cross-domain authentication and access control mechanism.\n  Designing and developing data sharing and exchanging system.\n  ","date":1556323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556323200,"objectID":"c63754345e82f23fa2ff038c22807e95","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/project/blockchain-province/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/blockchain-province/","section":"project","summary":"Key Research \u0026 Development Program of Shaanxi Province, aiming to develop decentralized data sharing and access control mechanism.","tags":["Blockchain","IoT"],"title":"Trusted and controlled sharing technology and system of multi-domain IoT based on blockchain","type":"project"},{"authors":["Jiawei Zheng","Xuewen Dong","Tao Zhang","Junfeng Chen","Wei Tong","Xiaozhou Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539302400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539302400,"objectID":"9e7d0f158bde8ed6ca2e9ee6cda80f4f","permalink":"https://jia-wei-zheng.github.io/publication/microthingchain/","publishdate":"2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/microthingchain/","section":"publication","summary":"With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the surge in data generated by sensors and smart devices has caused data overload in designated centralized data centers. However, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage, cannot afford to manage these gigantic data in the suitable way. Due to the lots of devices and senors continuously creating data, traditional IoT architectures must address many challenges that are not designed to provide trust, security, resiliency, and low latency. To solve theses problems, we propose a decentralized architecture named MicrothingsChain based on blockchain with smart contract, which enables edge computing nodes storing corresponding domain IoT data and interacting with each other safely. It brings computing and storage capabilities to the edge of the IoT network and realizes distributed storage of large amounts of data. Specially, MicrothingsChain adopts publish-subscribe mode, in which users can access the data across domain. Furthermore, we present one cryptographic currency for our ecology named MicroCoin. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that MicrothingsChain is suitable in practice.","tags":[],"title":"MicrothingsChain: Edge Computing and Decentralized IoT Architecture Based on Blockchain for Cross-Domain Data Sharing ","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project aims to develope a intelligent service trasaction system based on crowd sourcing and blockchain technologiee so that it can meet the requirements of high performance and supervision.\nIn particular, we develope a service-oriented and high-precision service publishing and composition system.
